        <p>I happened upon Teriyaki Boy Grill Express when I was departing for a road trip. Because of the events of the day, I was leaving significantly later than I intended and I was exhausted as I anticipated the drive. Feeling cold and grumpy, I just wanted warm comforting food without delaying my departure longer.
        </p>
        <p>As it was a pretty busy evening for them, I got my Miso Soup immediately while I waited on my order of their Chicken Teriyaki with white rice & vegetables (options for fried rice, noodles, brown rice, or mushrooms). To say that the miso soup hit the spot is an understatement. It was calming and revitalizing. After a wait of five to ten minutes, I got the Chicken Teriyaki order. For the fast food vibe of the restaurant, I was half expecting the pre-cooked and thoroughly dried out offerings that you find at many chains. However, the chicken was remarkably	fresh and juicy. I'm grateful that I found them locally before my departure because I find myself craving that miso soup and chicken teriyaki frequently now.
